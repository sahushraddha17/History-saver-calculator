1 - Python Calculator

A simple yet efficient **command-line calculator* built using *Python*.  
This project performs basic arithmetic operations,  keeps a *calculation history* stored in a text file.

It’s designed to demonstrate *core Python programming concepts* like functions, loops, conditionals, file handling, and user input handling — making it a great beginner-friendly and portfolio-ready project.

2 - Features
- ✅ Perform arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- ✅ Supports two-number calculations (e.g., `2 + 3`, `5 * 8`)
- ✅ Maintains a *calculation history* in a `history.txt` file
- ✅ View or clear history anytime
- ✅ Handles invalid input and division-by-zero errors gracefully
- ✅ Interactive command-line interface for continuous use

3 -  Python Concepts Demonstrated
This project showcases several *core concepts of Python*:

( Concept , Description )
| File Handling | Reads, writes, and appends data to `history.txt` |
| Functions | Modular functions for calculation, history, and clearing |
| Loops | Continuous program execution until user exits |
| Conditional Statements | Used for operator handling and validation |
| String Manipulation | Splitting and parsing user inputs |
| Type Casting | Converting string inputs into numeric types |
| Error Handling | Managing invalid inputs and division-by-zero |
| Operators | Use of all basic arithmetic and exponentiation operators |

How to Run the Project

4 - 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/sahushraddha17/History-Saver-Calculator.git


2. Navigate to the Project Folder
cd History-Saver-Calculator


3. Run the Calculato
python CALCULATOR.PY

History saved automatically!
Next time you can type history to view all your previous calculations.
If you want clear history you can clear it.
